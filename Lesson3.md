Recording changes to the repository
==================
#### 1. **Cloning an existing repository**

If you want to copy of an existing directory, the command you need is 'git clone'. Take a note that there is another command is 'git checkout'
and the difference between them is that while 'git checkout' allow you to get just a working copy, 'git clone' give you a full copy
of nearly full data that the server has. Every version of every file for the history of the project is pulled down by defaul when you
run 'git clone'.
